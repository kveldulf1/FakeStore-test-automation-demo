# FakeStore-test-automation-demo
My test automation demo project with usage of Java, Selenium and JUnit.

Please keep in mind that the project uses Selenium Grid and it is necessary to start the hub and node prior to test execution.
In order to do so, please take these steps:

1. Download and unpack the SeleniumServer.rar file to C:\SeleniumServer\
2. Run starthub.bat file.
3. Run startnode.bat file.

The project is compatible with Chrome and Firefox, standard execution will be performed with Chrome.
If you wish to change the browser that will be used to execute tests, please go to Configuration.properties and change CHROME to FIREFOX (capital letters are required).

Should you have any questions do not hesitate to contact me.
